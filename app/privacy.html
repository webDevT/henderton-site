			<p>This web site is not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.</p>
			<p>CONTROLLER</p>
			<p>Henderton Limited is a limited company registered in England and Wales.

We will let you know which entity will be the controller for your data when you engage us to provide services to you.  Henderton Limited is the controller and responsible for this web site.</p>
			<p>We have appointed a data protection officer (DPO) who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this privacy notice.  If you have any questions about this privacy notice, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact the DPO at: DPO@henderton.com.</p>
			<p>You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk).  We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.</p>
			<p>CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY NOTICE AND YOUR DUTY TO INFORM US OF CHANGES</p>
			<p>This version was updated in September 2020.  Any changes to this privacy notice will be posted on this web site and will be effective on posting.</p>
			<p>It is important that the personal data we hold about you are accurate and current.  Please keep us informed if your personal data change during your relationship with us.</p>
			<p>THIRD-PARTY LINKS</p>
			<p>This web site may include links to third-party web sites, plug-ins and applications.  Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you.  We do not control these third-party web sites and are not responsible for their privacy statements.

2. The data we collect about you
		</div>

		<p>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified.  It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>
		<p>We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:</p>
		<p>Identity Data such as your name, your employer, your title or position and your relationship to a person or information collected by us as part of our business acceptance processes.</p>
		<p>- Contact Data such as your billing address, email address and telephone numbers.</p>
		<p>- Financial Data such as bank account details.</p>
		<p>- Technical Data such as information from your visit to our web site, or in relation to materials and communications we send to you electronically, including your IP address.</p>
		<p>- Marketing and Communications Data such as your preferences in receiving marketing from us, your communication preferences and information you provide to us for the purposes of attending meetings and events, including access and dietary requirements.</p>
		<p>- Personal Information provided to us by or on behalf of our clients, partners and employees or generated by us in the course of providing services and employment, including applications for employment submitted to us, which may include special categories of data.
</p>
		<p>We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose.  Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but are not considered personal data in law as these data do not directly or indirectly reveal your identity.  For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific web site feature.  However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that they can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.</p>
		<p>IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</p>
		<p>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide those data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you.  In this case, we may not be able to provide the requested service to you, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>
	</div>


	<div class="privacy-item">
		<div class="privacy-title">
3. How are your personal data collected
		</div>

		<p>We use different methods to collect data from and about you including:</p>

technical information about your visit, such as your internet
protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, time zone
setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions,
operating system and platform and other technology on the
devices you use to access the web site. We collect such data
for administrative and statistical purposes and to help us
operate and improve our web site</p>
		<p>- If you make an enquiry by email or telephone, we will collect
your name and contact information, which will be used to
respond to your enquiry. We may also keep records of such
communications and / or add your contact details to our
business database, if we believe that we may have a good
reason to contact you in the future.</p>
		<p>- If you register to receive our newsletter or updates from us,
we will collect, store and use your name and contact

our business database at any point by opting out or contacting
us.</p>
		<p>- If you register (or are invited by a member) to attend an event
organised by us, we will use your name, contact details and the
name of the organisation you work in connection with
organising the event. We will store such information in our
database and our staff or relevant partners will be able to
access it.</p>
		<p>- If you are applying to work with Henderton, for example as a
contractor, consultant or vendor, we will collect, store and use
the information you provide to us in your application and any
information you provide to us during your interview to assess
your suitability for the role, to communicate with you about the
engagement process, to make a decision as to whether to enter
into a contract with you and to keep records of our hiring

		<p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most
commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>
		<p>- Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter
into or have entered into with you.</p>
		<p>- Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a
third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not
override those interests.</p>
		<p>- Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your
personal data other than in relation to sending third party direct marketing
communications to you via email or text message. You have the right to
withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.</p>
		<p>PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE WILL USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</p>
		<p>We have set out below a description of the principal ways we plan to use
your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We

CHANGE OF PURPOSE

		<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we

5. Disclosures of your personal data
		</div>
		<p>We may need to transfer personal data to third parties, including third
parties based outside the EEA, such as other advisors, accountants and
third parties involved in your matters.</p>
		<p>We require all third parties, including our affiliates, to respect the security
of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do
not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for
their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data
for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
		
	</div>


<div class="privacy-item">
		<div class="privacy-title">
6. International Transfers
		</div>
		<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a
similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the
following safeguards is implemented:</p>
		<p>- We will only transfer your personal data to countries which
have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection
for personal data by the European Commission.</p>
		<p>- Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific
contracts approved by the European Commission which give
personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</p>
<p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific
mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the
EEA.</p>
		
	</div>

	<div class="privacy-item">
		<div class="privacy-title">
7. Data Security
		</div>
		<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an
unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to
your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other
third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process
your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of
confidentiality.</p>
		<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data
breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where
we are legally required to do so.</p>
	</div>


	<div class="privacy-item">
		<div class="privacy-title">
8. Data Retention
		</div>
		<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the
purposes we collected them for, including for the purposes of satisfying
any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
		<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the
potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and
whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
applicable legal requirements.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="privacy-item">
		<div class="privacy-title">
9. Your Legal Rights
		</div>

		<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws
in relation to your personal data.</p>
		<p>- Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a
“data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a
copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that
we are lawfully processing them.</p>
		<p>- Request correction of the personal data that we hold about
you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate
data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to
verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
		<p>- Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask
us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good
reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right
to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you
have successfully exercised your right to object to processing
(see below), where we may have processed your information
unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal
data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not
always be able to comply with your request of erasure for
specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable,
at the time of your request.</p>
		<p>- Object to processing of your personal data where we are
relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and
there is something about your particular situation which makes
you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it
impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also
have the right to object where we are processing your personal
data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may
demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to
process your information which override your rights and
freedoms.</p>
		<p>- Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This
enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your
personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to
establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is
unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need
us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need
it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have
objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether
we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
		<p>
- Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third
party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen,
your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-
readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated
information which you initially provided consent for us to use
or where we used the information to perform a contract with
you.</p>
		<p>- Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent
to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the
lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw
your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be
able to provide certain products or services to you. We will
advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your
consent.</p>
		<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.
NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED</p>
		<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise
any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your
request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we
may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
	</div>


		<div class="privacy-item">
		<div class="privacy-title">
WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU
		</div>
		<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm
your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to
exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure
that personal data are not disclosed to any person who has no right to
receive them. We may also contact you to ask you for further information
in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
	
	</div>

	<div class="privacy-item">
		<div class="privacy-title">
TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND
		</div>
		<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is
particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case,
we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
	
	</div>

		<div class="privacy-title">
10. Glossary
		</div>

		<p>LAWFUL BASIS</p>
		<p>Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and
managing our business to enable us to give you the best service / product
and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and
balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your
rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests.
We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are
overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are
otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further
information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any
potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.
Performance of Contract means processing your data where it is necessary
for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps
at your request before entering into such a contract.
Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation means processing your
personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or
regulatory obligation that we are subject to.</p>
